## Code Reflection
* Question 2 Assignment 6: The code I used for my data frame was slightly different from the code professor Ash used.
```{r}
# Mine:
# iris1 <- filter(iris, Species == "virginica" | Species == "versicolor", Sepal.Length > 6,  Sepal.Width > 2.5)

# Professor Ash's:
# iris1 <- filter(iris, Species %in% c("virginica", "versicolor"), Sepal.Length > 6, Sepal.Width > 2.5)

```
* Question 8 Assignment 6: professor Ash included an 'arrange()' command in the piping function, resulting in a different tibble of '2*5'


## Code Annotation
```{r}
# Copy my code into an Rmd file and annotate what each ggplot line of code is doing, including any arguments. You can use a combination of ‘trial/error coding:’ change the arguments/options to visually see how it affects the plot.


library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggplot2)

# Data obtained from Veysey Powell and Babbitt 2016: An experimental test of buffer utility as a technique for managing pool-breeding amphibians

           y=count.total.adults, fill=factor(year))) + # fill=factor(year) assigns different color to each bar, each bar represents # of breeding adults per year
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat="identity", color="black") + # default position is stacking, "dodge" makes the bars stand side by side and not stacked on top of each other.
  # stat ="identity" tells geom_bar that your data has 'y' values, # color assigns an outline to the border of the bars with the specified value

  facet_wrap(~species, nrow=2, strip.position="right") + # assigns column names to graph titles, and then positions these graph titles where you want them to be
  theme_few() + scale_fill_grey() + # assigns a color palette to the bars, can also use scale_fill_hue, scale_fill_brewer, paletteer::scale_fill_paletteer_d
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'gray94', color = 'black'), # adds a border and fill to the panels with the color and fill assigned
