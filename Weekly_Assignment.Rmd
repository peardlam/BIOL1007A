# How To Set Up Github Webpage in R-Studio

## First steps involve Github:

1. Create your Github profile and repository   
   + Create profile
   + Log in and click "Create Repository", and name it (e.g. your class). Use an underscore in place of a 'space' between words
   + Make it "public", add a `README` file and an MIT license   
   + Do not click on `Add .gitignore` because Git will generate that once you've linked your Github repository to RStudio
   + Click on "Create Repository"     
2. Generate your Github Personal Access Token (PAT):
   + Sign into Github
   + Click on your profile icon on the top right corner, and click on 'settings' on the drop down menu.
   + On the left side menu, scroll down and click on 'Developer settings'
   + Click on 'Personal access tokens' and choose the 'Tokens (classic)' option
   + Click on 'Generate new token' and pick the **Classic option**
   + For the note, write the name of your repository
   + Under 'Expiration', there is a 'custom' option that allows you to choose your own date of expiration.
   + Click the repo check box, and then scroll down to click on "Generate Token"
   + **Copy the entire token number** generated and paste it in a document, and save that document.
   + You will use this PAT for all the repositories that you decide to link to R projects

## Installing Git:   
Definition: git is a version control software that is used to track the project, which is located in Github, in your local drive.

3. Install Git onto your local drive  
   + Since you will be using a macbook, you will need to first download the Xcode app onto your laptop.  
   + Then you will need to download HomeBrew - copy and paste this code: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` into Terminal to dowload it.
   + Then download and install Git onto your laptop
   
## Moving onto RStudio

4. Creating R project:    
Definition: an R project helps separate your classes or research projects on Github (i.e. if you have multiple repositories) into different contexts. You can generate a main webpage and website links within each R project
   + open RStudio
   + Click on 'New Project' on the drop down menu on the top right corner of the screen
   + Click on 'Version Control' and then select the Git option.
   + **A quick U-turn to Github**:    
     * On Github click on your repository and click on the 'code' green button      
     * Click on the clipboard sign to copy the URL that shows up on the drop down menu
   + Paste this on the URL box showing on RStudio after selecting the Git option.
   + Give your R project the exact name as your repository on Github
   + Use the browse button to find a suitable location on your laptop to save your project, e.g. your desktop. Do not save it onto your downloads folder.
   + click `Create Project` to finish
   + add files that do not need to be tracked on the *.gitignore* file, such as *.pdf* files
   + In the console type this `install.packages("credentials")` to install the 'credentials' package
   + Then run this code:     
   `git config --global user.email "put github email here"`      
`git config --global user.name "put your name here"`        
`credentials::set_github_pat("put Personal Access Token here")`
   
### Building a webpage that will be hosted in Github
5. Create R Markdown file for webpage
   + Click on the + sign on the top left corner in RStudio and select R Markdown
   + Change the title to the name of your research project/ class
   + Save this file as "index" (it will automatically saved as an .Rmd file)
   + Click on the Knit button.
6. Save these changes to Github
   + On terminal type and run:
      * git status
      * git add -A (displays the files that have been changed/created)
      * git status
      * git commit -am ‘first commit’ (makes local commit) (a commit is a 'snapshot' of your current file system at that moment)
      * git status
      * git push (pushes the changes up to your GitHub repository)
7. **Another U-turn to Github**
   + Return to Github and click on 'settings'
   + Under 'Source' change to 'master branch' (initially it will read 'None')
   + Click the link under "Your site is ready to be published at…"
   + It will take a few minutes for your webpage to be displayed

## Creating more webpages and putting their links on your main webpage, i.e. your portfolio
8. To create more R markdown files within the same project, refer to step 5. 
9. If you want them to all appear on your initial webapage (which is now your portfolio), you can do so by creating links for them:
   + After creating and knitting a new R markdown file, go back to your "index.Rmd" file.
   + On the 'Source' panel type this: `[Name of Link](assignment_name.html)` (ensure that it is the html file)
10. After this refer to steps 6 - 7 to ensure that these changes are uploaded to Github

### Extras:
This is your first time setting up a Github webpage in RStudio and it is normal for you to run into a few problems. The notes I have presented serve as an initial guide, if you run into problems after this point click on `Help` on the `Plots / Files / Help` panel and type a keyword in the search engine. You can also use Google; there are many websites on Google that have useful information on using Github and RStudio. 

### Useful Links:
1. [Pretty Doc](https://prettydoc.statr.me/) This will offer nice alternative R markdown themes to make your webpages aesthetically pleasing.
2. [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) 

**All The Best!**
